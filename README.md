Pneumonia Analysis
Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to raise awareness about pneumonia and provide an AI-powered tool for analyzing chest X-ray images. The tool uses a Teachable Machine model to predict potential pneumonia indicators from uploaded images or live webcam input.

Features
Pneumonia Information: Learn about pneumonia, its symptoms, risk factors, and prevention methods.
Image Analysis: Upload a chest X-ray or CT scan image or use your webcam to analyze the image for potential pneumonia indicators.
AI-Powered Predictions: The application uses a pre-trained Teachable Machine model to provide predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation and usage.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
AI Model: Teachable Machine (TensorFlow.js)
Libraries:
Teachable Machine Image Library
TensorFlow.js
How It Works
The user navigates to the Image Analysis section.
The user can either:
Upload a chest X-ray or CT scan image.
Use their webcam to capture a live image of a chest X-ray or CT scan.
The application processes the image using the Teachable Machine model.
The results are displayed, showing the likelihood of pneumonia indicators.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
A working webcam (optional, for live analysis).
