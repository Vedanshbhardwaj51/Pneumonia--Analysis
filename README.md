🫁 Pneumonia Analysis
📌 Overview
Pneumonia Analysis is a web-based application designed to raise awareness about pneumonia and assist in preliminary diagnosis using artificial intelligence. The tool leverages a pre-trained Teachable Machine model to analyze chest X-ray images or live webcam input and predict possible pneumonia indicators.

🚀 Features
Educational Resources: Learn about pneumonia, including symptoms, risk factors, and prevention tips.

AI Image Analysis: Upload a chest X-ray/CT scan or use a webcam to detect pneumonia indicators.

Teachable Machine Integration: Uses a trained TensorFlow.js model for real-time analysis.

Responsive Interface: Clean and intuitive UI for a smooth user experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

AI Model: Teachable Machine (via TensorFlow.js)

Key Libraries:

Teachable Machine Image Library

TensorFlow.js

🧠 How It Works
Navigate to the Image Analysis section.

Choose an input method:

Upload a chest X-ray or CT scan image.

Capture a live image via webcam.

The image is analyzed using the Teachable Machine model.

Results are displayed with a prediction of potential pneumonia presence.

🧩 Setup Instructions
✅ Prerequisites
Modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Webcam (optional, for live capture)

⚙️ Running the Project
